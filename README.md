# AutoBCAProcess
This program is part of a data processing program for a specific purpsose as part of my work as a scientist. The goal of the program is to take input from a text file, parse it and place the proper values into the appropriate cells in an excel sheet. The data is related to something called a BCA assay which is a method for determining protein concentration based upon the absorbance of a sample. At my work we use a machine that scan samples and ouputs the data as a .txt file. 

This program works in two steps. First the python script BCA.py takes the output from the machine and parses out the important numbers. Then the AutoBSA program works on the output of BCA.py. ("BSA" is an unfortunate typo I did not notice until later. Interestingly however, BSA is an abbreviation for a protein). The AutoBCA program takes input and using an existing C++ library, LibXL (http://www.libxl.com/) and puts the output into a template excel sheet that does further calculations. Basically this program saves me some copy and pasting at work!
